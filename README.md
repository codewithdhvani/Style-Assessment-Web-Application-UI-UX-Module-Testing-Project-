Style Assessment Web Application – UI/UX & Module Testing Project 

This project is an AI-powered personal styling web application designed to deliver a highly personalized fashion and wardrobe guidance experience. The platform guides users through a structured, multi-step onboarding journey where they answer a series of questions related to their style preferences, color knowledge, body attributes, wardrobe habits, and fashion challenges.

Based on user inputs such as age, height, weight, skin tone, hair color, eye color, body shape, and aesthetic vibe, the system builds a comprehensive user profile to generate customized style recommendations. Key features include preference discovery flows, capsule wardrobe planning, virtual try-on, selfie-based color analysis, results processing, subscription plan selection, OTP verification, and final onboarding completion.

The application focuses on enhancing user confidence, reducing poor purchase decisions, and improving wardrobe utilization by combining guided questionnaires with intelligent personalization. The end goal is to provide an effortless, data-driven styling experience that is intuitive, engaging, and scalable for a wide range of users.
